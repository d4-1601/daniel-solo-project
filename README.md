# How App Should Work

## Usage
1. User logs and is redirected to the profile page where it's possible to set the household information.
2. The user add his/her lifestyle data, and a tag name to identify the period of the data entry. The transport figures would come from googlemaps app, but in this case, I'm using mock data.
3. After submitting the data, by clicking on submit button, the user is redirected to the tracker page to see previous submissions and what was neutralized.
4. Then, the user can choose one of the options to neutralize their carbon emissions for that period.
